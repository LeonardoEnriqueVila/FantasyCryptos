# Fantasy Cryptocurrency Simulation

This project is a fantasy cryptocurrency simulation where users can view real-time prices, charts, and buy and sell simulated cryptocurrencies. The project uses Python and various modules.

## Description

The Fantasy Cryptocurrency Simulation allows users to simulate trading cryptocurrencies in a fictional market. Prices are updated in real-time, and users can view historical price charts, execute buy and sell orders, and track their portfolio. Fictional events make some coins to change their tendency and volatily. 

## Features

- Real-time cryptocurrency prices
- Historical price charts using Matplotlib
- Buy and sell simulated cryptocurrencies
- Track portfolio value and performance

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For the core logic and simulation
- **Tkinter**: For the graphical user interface
- **Threading**: To handle real-time updates
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting price charts
- **Random**: To generate random values
